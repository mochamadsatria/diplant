# DIPLANT

Dipping into the vast of plant world

## Inspiration

Diamond app, Wikipedia, etc

## What it does

Provide whoever like me who is curious about plants with useful info.

## How we built it

I create it with Figma, react, Tailwind CSS, DESO identity, and Echo3d. I first create the UI and the pages, then I implement the plant catalog, then implement echo3d to showcase the plant. You can access the AR within the plant page. The last part is solving the puzzle of DESO identity and transaction.

## Challenges we ran into

It's quite challenging to implement a post-submit A.K.A transaction after the user submits the form, so I decided to finish the operation there because of my lack of experience. Also finding the right DESO integration documentation is hard, I need to run back and forth googling to get it done and finally found some node.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is my first time implementing crypto. So I'm kinda proud of it.

## What we learned

Concept about a node in DESO and how to implement it. Also learn that the easiest way to implement echo3d (Google Scene Viewer) is actually not so compatible with many devices at this time but it's great technology to give attention to.

## What's next for Untitled

Better in every aspect :)
